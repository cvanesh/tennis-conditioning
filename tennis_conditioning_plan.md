# PROGRAM NOTES & GUIDELINES

## Safety Considerations

1. **Proper Form First:** Never sacrifice technique for speed or reps
2. **Listen to Your Body:** Distinguish between muscle fatigue and pain
3. **Hydration:** Drink water before, during, and after sessions
4. **Nutrition:** Eat protein and carbs within 30 minutes post-workout
5. **Sleep:** Aim for 8-10 hours per night for optimal recovery

## When to Skip or Modify

**Skip a session if:**
- Feeling ill or feverish
- Experiencing sharp joint pain
- Extreme fatigue from lack of sleep
- Recent injury (consult healthcare provider)

**Modify by reducing:**
- Volume (sets/reps) by 30-50%
- Intensity (slower tempo, less weight)
- Range of motion if experiencing tightness

## Progression Indicators

**Signs the program is working:**
- Improved court movement speed
- Better endurance late in matches
- Increased serve velocity
- Reduced muscle soreness over weeks
- Improved body control and balance
- Better posture and athleticism

## Post-Program Recommendations

After completing this 8-week program:

1. **Take 3-5 days of active recovery** (light tennis, swimming, cycling)
2. **Compare Week 8 test results to baseline**
3. **Repeat program with increased weights/heights**
4. **Progress to intermediate junior program**
5. **Continue 2-3 maintenance sessions per week during season**

## Equipment Progression Guide

**Medicine Ball Weights:**
- Week 1-2: 1 kg (2.2 lbs)
- Week 3-4: 1-2 kg (2.2-4.4 lbs)
- Week 5-8: 2-3 kg (4.4-6.6 lbs)

**Box Heights:**
- Week 1-2: 12 inches
- Week 3-4: 16 inches
- Week 5-6: 18 inches
- Week 7-8: 20-24 inches

**Resistance Bands:**
- Start: Light (5-10 lbs resistance)
- Progress: Medium (10-20 lbs resistance)

## Parent/Coach Supervision

**Coach should monitor:**
- Exercise form and technique
- Fatigue levels (stop if form deteriorates)
- Progression readiness
- Recovery status
- Motivation and enjoyment

**Provide feedback on:**
- Quality of movement
- Intensity appropriateness
- Breathing patterns
- Body alignment

## Injury Prevention Reminders

1. **Never skip warm-up or cool-down**
2. **Progress gradually** (no more than 10% increase weekly)
3. **Focus on bilateral development** (train both sides equally)
4. **Include shoulder stability work** (critical for tennis)
5. **Maintain flexibility** through daily stretching
6. **Cross-train** occasionally (swimming, cycling for variety)

## Mental Development

- **Set weekly goals** beyond just physical outcomes
- **Track progress** in a training journal
- **Celebrate small wins** each week
- **Develop work ethic** through consistent attendance
- **Build confidence** through measurable improvements
