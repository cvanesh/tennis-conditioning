WHY YOUR 12-YEAR-OLD MAY NOT BE OPTIMAL ON TOURNAMENT DAYS

Based on research, here are the likely culprits:

    Insufficient Sleep:
        Needs 10-12 hours as a 12-year-old
        Tournament stress often disrupts sleep
        Early matches without early enough bedtime
    Nutrition Timing Errors:
        Research shows 80% of junior players choose carb-dominant meals, but timing is everything
        Eating too close to match (digestive issues)
        Not eating enough 2-4 hours before
        Missing the 30-minute post-match recovery window
    Inadequate Warm-Up:
        Early morning matches need EXTRA time
        Cold muscles = decreased performance + injury risk
        Many juniors rush this
    Hydration Gaps:
        Starting matches already dehydrated
        Not drinking enough between matches
        Relying on thirst (by then it's too late)
    Energy System Mismatch:
        Tennis requires glycogen stores
        If not properly loaded with carbs 12-24 hours before, performance suffers
        Multiple matches deplete stores rapidly
    Mental Preparation:
        Lack of consistent pre-match routine creates anxiety
        No familiar structure to calm nerves

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

Week Before Tournament:

    ✓ Practice bedtime routine (8:30 PM)
    ✓ Test pre-match meals (find what digests well)
    ✓ Practice full warm-up routine
    ✓ Prepare tournament bag with all snacks/drinks

Tournament Day:

    ✓ Follow timeline exactly
    ✓ Set alarms for meal times
    ✓ Track hydration (aim for light yellow urine)
    ✓ Don't skip any phase

Post-Tournament:

    ✓ Review what worked/didn't work
    ✓ Adjust for next tournament
    ✓ Maintain sleep schedule even after tournament

This protocol is based on research showing elite junior players significantly outperform peers through structured match-day routines. The key is consistency - following the same routine builds confidence and physiological readiness.
